## Reflection Questions
1. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
- Understanding what every functions in JS did was quite tricky to understand. I thoroughly read the descriptions and looked for any new inbuild functions used inside the function in order to understand the code better.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- I need to learn how to deploy it in web.
- I want to learn a lot more cause web development has a lot of stuffs that I can learn, so I need to know where can I find the resources.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- I would add few more buttons to make game little more complex
- i would maybe create new pages that we can navigate from the first page, so that if user wants to play only 4 buttons game, he could navigatet o one page and if more than 4 buttons he could navigate to other pages.
- I would style little bit more.
