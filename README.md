## Reflection Questions
1. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
- While I felt like there weren't any big challenges, I did enjoy it quite a bit. My only challenge was how to implement the game logic. I decided not to examine the answer but to implement it on my own so it was quite tricky but later I corrected my implemenrarion by looking at the answers provided from the book. The guess function requires us to implement various helper functions within the function itself. So, for this I had to generate and analyze the condition tree carefully. I split various possible scenarios carefully and considered them one by one. The algorithms got easier as I pictiured various scenarios in my head as response to change in global variables. I at first created the function by adding more functionalities but later realized the code with more functionalities is not the optimized version and modified the function by looking at the given solution accordingly. Understanding what every functions in JS did was quite tricky to understand. I thoroughly read the descriptions and looked for any new inbuild functions used inside the function in order to understand the code better.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- I need to learn how to deploy it in web.
- I want to learn a lot more cause web development has a lot of stuffs that I can learn, so I need to know where can I find the resources.
- How to create similar project but with navigation to different page. 
- How to make the webpage dynamic?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- I would add few more buttons to make game little more complex
- i would maybe create new pages that we can navigate from the first page, so that if user wants to play only 4 buttons game, he could navigatet o one page and if more than 4 buttons he could navigate to other pages.
- I would style little bit more.
- I added few more buttons on index.html after figuring out the other frequencies. And i spent quite a bit of time figuring out the additional pair of color. 
- If i had more time and I would refractor the guess button and optimize it more. 
Overall, I really enjoyed this and I am pretty confident with the web development. Being a fast learner I believe, I can confidently progress a lot in my web development skills also having knowledge of mobile app design, java script, some react backs this up.
